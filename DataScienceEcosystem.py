# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[8]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.
(3*4)+5


# In[9]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minute=200
hour=minute/60
print(f"total hour is {hour}")


# ## Objectives:
#     1) Evaluating Arithmetic Expression
#     2) Commonly used libraries used bt Data Scientist
#     3) Popular Environment for Data Science
#     4) List of Data Science tools
